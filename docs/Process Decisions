Design & Development Process Decisions

Before we dive into coding our solutions, there are some decisions we need to make.

1. Requirements process: feature driven or use case driven?

Use case driven. The software needs to do very specific things, so we will structure our
development process after achieving said functionality.

2. Development process: test driven (TDD) or not test driven (TLD)? Briefly describe
your approach.

Test driven. Since our most crucial code has to do with hours and time, testing is
essential so that we don’t end up in any weird time corruptions.

3. Workload process: scrum/sprints or Kanban? Something else? Briefly describe your process.

Kanban github board + periodic meetings. We will rely on strong design documents to break
down the software into modular, functionally isolated parts which will work perfectly with
the kanban board and allow us to easily divide up the tasks.

4. Estimation & Task planning: how to parallelize work & accurately estimate tasks?

Front-End:

Back-End:

5. Software & tools:

·Coordinating communication among team members
Discord, WhatsApp

·Task management
GitHub

·Coordinating development among team members (consider git)
Git

·Tech stack (what technologies you will rely on to develop the application)
Bootstrap, HTML, Django REST Api, JS.

6. Communication: what is the expected turn around time for group communication?
Expected communication times: 4pm - [ ]pm
Within 24 hours

7. Accountability: Imagine there is a missed deliverable (no judging the reason why the
deliverable was missed). What is the group policy for handling that situation and objectively
holding all team members accountable for their assigned tasks?

Learning is the goal: we do not wish to impose harsh penalties for missing deadlines.
As long as the individual team member has (1) put in real effort to solve the problem,
(2) communicated their struggles and why they were unable to finish the feature on time
and (3) was proactive in resolving the issue, the team will have their back. Only
circumstance in which the team will start penalizing members is if they (1) miss a
deliverable, (2) are not proactive in communicating why and (3) have not attempted to
resolve the issue on their own to the best of their ability.

All disputes can be resolved by referring to the edit histories on the team documents and repository.
